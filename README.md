DSC40B Fall 2025 Starter Code

Hi everyone, welcome to the Fall 2025 offering of DSC 40B: Theoretical Foundations of Data Science II!

To begin with, I will walk you through a quick tutorial on how to pull the starter code from this repository. First, you want to go to your terminal and do the following in your desktop's working directory:

```bash
mkdir dsc40b_fa25 # if you have not created the folder already
cd ./dsc40b_fa25
git clone https://github.com/dsc-courses/DSC40B_FA25_StarterCode.git
```

What you are doing above is creating a new folder called dsc40b_fa25 (hence `mkdir dsc40b_fa25`), then moving into that directory (`cd = change directory`), and cloning whatever files can be found inside the git repository. 
For every homework with programming problems, we will release a new startercode for the homework, and if you followed the above steps properly, you need not repeat it again for the following weeks. You can get whatever files we upload using the git command:

```bash
git pull
```
And this will keep your remote repository up-to-date with the most recent starter code we will provide you with. 
**Now that you have the starter code, you can copy and paste all the files into your own git repository which you will submit on gradescope.**

Good luck!
